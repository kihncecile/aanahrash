Here's my story. I built a PC 8 months ago it was meant to be powerful and have "extensive" storage, the case is able to fit 11 3.5" HDD and the mobo has itself 10 SATA ports (only 5 support AHCI mode in fact) but now, I'm starting to split my daily tasks between this and another machines, using the same storage and I'm starting to think into moving those to a fully network based storage. Running 24/7 a computer with an i7 is too much power waste, in terms of electricity but also in terms.

What should I look into if I want an energy-efficient server? I originally got a Raspberry Pi expecting to be able to set up a media server and run borg on it where all my machines will periodically back up to (initiate a backup over the LAN every few hours). I should of known it can't really handle either of these tasks at a practical level, so I'm looking for something more powerful. Since the server is purely only for me and this fact will not change, I'm more interested in something I was looking into getting the C2750 Atom for a freeNAS build so I looked up some benchmarks. It's pretty weak even for all those cores. Why wouldn't one just get a low TDP Pentium? The models with T have a 35W TDP, are cheaper, have an upgrade path, support ecc, faster single threaded performance, etc. why does the atom even exist? I don't think it's the extra sata ports because I think the boards with >6 ports have an extra controller. Any idea why the atom might be better than a pentium. Thinking of preemptively replacing an important box before it C2000's out on me. It's a SYS-5018A-TN4. Probably going to get an R210 II with an E3, but do you guys have any suggestions? (similar power / price / size, something that's actually available on ebay US) Thanks. I know. I should have expected this and been more prepared, but today it happened, my AsRock Rack C2750D4l died. This was the core of my storage server which was also handling Plex and a few other things. Now for the questions that I pose to my lovely /r/homelab friends: Has anyone dealt with AsRock on the RMA process for these Avaton boards? Am I in for a lot of suffering or is it fairly good? I have another server I've been meaning to use to virtualize a storage. Hey there, I am running a server with the typicall stuff:  Webhosting (1x Wordpress, few html sites, 1x forum) Mail Server Froxlor for managing "customers" Teamspeak3 OpenVPN rTorrent ZNC  I want to upgrade and can choose between Intel c2750 with 8GB RAM or Core i5-750 wih 16GB RAM.  Which one would perform better as my future server? I think more RAM is more important for webhosting (e.g. wordpress)?  Thanks. I'm in the market for a new Freenas machine. After a bit of research, I found that the ASRock C2750D4I board is perfect for my needs. The key features I like are the very low TDP, 12 SATA ports, 32GB+ ECC support, IPMI. My only concern is this board is almost 2 years old. I would hate to spend all this money if something better is going to be released in the next few months. (I'm not in any big rush to pull the trigger on this) Is anyone familiar with the Intel release cycle for these Avoton. I want to build a low power nas. I remember a few years ago the Avoton boards like the ASRock c2750d4i were very popular to use in this type of application. Is there something ever/better I should be looking. Hello, Just got my hands on a P9A-I/C2750/SAS/4L bord. We had some HDD's over here so I wanted to build a ZFS cluster with this. Now the problem is I cannot see my disks in centos. lspci shows the 2 marvell controllers but an fdisk or something doesn't show anything. Any solutions. 
Anyone else had the C2750 or C2550 D4I boards die on them? Essentially it locked up earlier, managed to reboot it via IPMI (It's in a small co-lo so it's my remotelab really) and it worked for a little while then dropped offline again. IPMI is showing no info in FRU tab which isn't a good sign, Nothing on the remote console at all and although the IPMI claims it's able to powercycle it I'm not convinced. Thinking maybe the LPC clock issue has struck and it's now a paperweight but wondering. I am looking for a good price on a used i3 (preferably a low powered, 35W version). I am also looking for a 16 gb kit ECC memory (open to SODIMMs and UDIMMs, I will verify compatibility with the set up I end up going with), I am also looking for one of the Asrock or Supermicro socket 1150 C22 chipset motherboards with at least 6 sata ports and preferably an internal usb header. I am looking to build a NAS and haven't decided whether or not to go with an Avoton board I am looking in setting up a ZFS Storage Server in production for Citrix Xen Servers connected via ISCSI for High Avail. I have heard Xeon is the preferred CPU w/ ECC Memory. Has anyone setup a Intel Avoton with ZFS. From the reviews I have read Avoton is considered the little brother in Xeon World for tiny servers. ( Follow-up -- It looks like everyone here is on the same page as far as the Avoton goes. Being a strong believer in open source why would someone choose a Netapp vs doing a custom. I've been using an old ASRock motherboard for pfsense but I'm repurposing it and need to purchase something for pfsense. I have a 1gb connection and run a lot of packages such as snort,squid etc. I'm looking at the Xeon-D, and I'd probably get the supermicro X10SDV-4C-TLN4F. It's a 4 core 8 thread 2.2ghz Xeon with 35w tdp and DDR4. It's about 0 more than the older c2750 which I'm looking at the supermicro A1-SRI-2558F. The c2750 is 0 cheaper with 20w, 2.4ghz 8 core, ddr3. There'. Hello Server Fans, A few months ago I posed a question (https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/5538wo/vm_server_cpu/) asking if an Atom C2750 would be a good CPU to run a VM Server. I thought I would share my experience thus far. Spec: Supermicro 5018A-TN4 (https://www.supermicro.com/products/system/1U/5018/SYS-5018A-TN4.cfm) 16 Gig of Ram 8x2 500Gb SSD Hard Drive 2TB internal 72K 2TB 3.5” 72K USB3 OS is FreeBSD-11 using Bhyve as the hypervisor VM’s: w/ Ram FreeBSD Mail 1G FreeBSD. I'm looking at supermicro's C2750/C2758 motherboards trying to figure out if I can build a system up to 48 disks using a SAS expander. The problem is the these boards only have one or two PCI slots. The A1SAM-2750F motherboard looks to have the most potential with one x8 slot and one x4 slot. 24 disks would be good, 48 would be great for future expansion. I plan on running FreeNAS.
